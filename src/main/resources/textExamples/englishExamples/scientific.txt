The mitochondrion is often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell.
It plays a central role in ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation.
Energy is generated through the electron transport chain located in its inner membrane.
This organelle has its own DNA and reproduces independently of the nucleus.
Mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally in most species.
Disruption of mitochondrial function can lead to metabolic disorders.
These include mitochondrial myopathy and neurodegenerative diseases.
The structure consists of an outer membrane, inner membrane, and matrix.
Cristae increase surface area for biochemical reactions.
Reactive oxygen species are byproducts of mitochondrial respiration.
They can damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids if unregulated.
Antioxidant systems mitigate this oxidative stress.
Mitochondria are also involved in apoptosis, or programmed cell death.
Calcium signaling and heme synthesis are additional functions.
Studies in mitochondrial dynamics reveal ongoing fusion and fission.
These processes maintain mitochondrial health and distribution.
Mutations in mitochondrial genes are linked to aging processes.
Research continues into mitochondrial replacement therapy.
It offers hope for inherited mitochondrial disease treatment.
Future advances may enhance our understanding of cellular energy regulation.
