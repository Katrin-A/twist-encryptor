So yeah, I was just walking down the street,  
and suddenly this dog comes out of nowhere —  
like, totally out of the blue.  
It wasn’t even barking or anything, just staring.  
I’m like, “Okay, buddy, what’s your deal?”  
It looked kinda sad, honestly.  
So I sat down next to it, gave it a little pat.  
Guess what? It licked my hand and wagged its tail.  
Like we were best friends or something.  
Then this guy runs up all out of breath,  
turns out it was his dog and it had escaped.  
We both laughed about it, it was wild.  
Anyway, then I got coffee at that new place.  
Pretty decent, not amazing, but chill vibes.  
Met an old friend there by accident.  
We hadn’t talked in, like, two years.  
Ended up chatting for hours, just like old times.  
Funny how life throws stuff at you like that.  
Some days just feel like they’re meant to happen.  
You know what I mean?
