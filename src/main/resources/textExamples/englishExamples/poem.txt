Beneath a sky of midnight blue,  
The stars awaken, crisp and true.  
The moon ascends with silver light,  
To guide the dreams that roam the night.  

The trees, they whisper ancient songs,  
Of time and tides and rights and wrongs.  
The river hums its lullaby,  
To soothe the earth, to kiss the sky.  

A breeze flows soft through fields of gold,  
Where secrets of the past unfold.  
The owl calls out with haunted grace,  
A shadow dancing into space.  

My thoughts drift gently, far from here,  
To moments lost, both bright and clear.  
I write these lines to hold them still,  
As time moves on, against our will.  

Yet hope remains with morning's call,  
A promise rising over all.  
And though the dark may take its due,  
Each dawn begins the world anew.
